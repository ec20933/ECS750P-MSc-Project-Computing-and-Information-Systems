#Introduction

The code in the two Jupyternotebook files, 'Movie Collaborative Filtering Recommendation with SVD and KNNWithMeans.ipynb' and 'Hybrid context-based Collaborative Filtering model using Tensorflow.ipynb', was used to create multiple recommendation system models for my MSc Project. The files only contain a selection of the full code that I produced during this project as I experimented with many different tensorflow and KNN models. Almost all of the code in the files was used to create the models referenced in my MSc paper and I have omitted code involved in creating the other models.

#File 2: 'Movie Collaborative Filtering Recommendation with SVD and KNNWithMeans.ipynb'

I chose to use the surprise library since it is geared towards parameter tuning and granted me high control over my experiments.  I applied neighborhood (KNNWithMeans) and matrix-factorisation-based (SVD) methods. I applied pearson and cosine similarity measures to the models.
